  <h4 class="font-weight-bold phoneGap p-3"> About PhoneGap </h4>
    <p>
  PhoneGap is a hybrid app composed of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is processed in a native container that can run the code and compile it to be used as an app. It utilizes the webview of platforms (made to show the content) to run its application. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Advantages of PhoneGap
    <ul> 
    <li> It has a cross-pltform framework. You only need to use one platform to create and PhoneGap will do the rest to spread it throughout different platforms. It helps developers save time so it is efficient and quick. </li>
      <br>
      <li> It has compatible and easy-to-use plugins. Developers can access device functions like cameras, GPS, local storage,and more. </li>
      <br>
      <li> It keeps everything together and alike. The design you made would look  the same across different platforms. You don't have to worry about things looking different in one and not the other.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
  <p>
  However, you do need to note that there is an expiration date to the use of plugins which will affect the app function. So you'll need to constantly check for updates on your plugins. Also, it may not work so well with gaming apps because you might experience glitches and error popups when you test it.

   <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-4 flutter"> About Flutter </h4>
    <p>
 Flutter is a software development kit made by Google that allows cross-platform app development in high-quality. In order to develop your app, you need to write your code in the Dart programming language which makes the developing process faster and easier. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Advantages of Flutter
    <ul> 
    <li> It has an abundant collection of widgets which builds the base of the app. Unlike PhoneGap, it doesn't rely on the webview or device. It provide its own component instead of using the native components.   </li>
      <br>
      <li> The Dart programming language makes it easy for developers to discover bugs and resolve them in the app. It has the functions of Dart Analyzer and the DevTools suite to help. Also, it provides good support in automated testing so developers can consistently upgrade their app's qualities through optimization. </li>
      <br>
      <li> It is fast! Due to the Dart language, it doesn't need to use a Javascript brdige so no interaction between the pages and the client's application is necessary. Thus, the app can be responsive and fast.  </li>
 </ul>
  </p>
<p>
  Even though Flutter makes things very simple and quick, its programming language is not well-known so not many developers know how to use it. Also, it takes up more space because of their built-in widgets. Despite their own set of widgets, they are insufficient in thrid-party libraries which is vital to app features and functions.

    <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-4 react"> About React Native </h4>
 <p>
 React Native is a popular open-source Javascript framework. Developers are able to make an app on various platforms with just one code base. This was made by Facebook. It provides "native" factors of the platform (views and components) and can access certain features of OS in the app. It doesn't use webviews. Unlike Flutter, it does use the idea of "bridge" which connects Native and Javascript elements so developers can use many OS-native features. Due to this use of native-written code, it will not be 
  running as slow as compared to web-based cross-platforms. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Advantages of React Native
    <ul> 
    <li> Developers can use the same code on multiple platforms. They do not have to deal with multiple code bases which saves time on development and marketing. If they want to modify or update something, it'll be easier and cheaper. It is also beginner friendly for new developers as the onboarding process is not very problematic.  </li>
      <br>
      <li> It provides a hot reloading feature so developers can see code changes live without refreshing. It gives real-time feedback which will fasten productivity. They can also just reload certain parts.   </li>
      <br>
      <li> It is an expanding and evolving framework in the market. It continues to update and give new features. Many people use this so if there is an issue that a developer can't solve, others can help. If you are a fast-paced mobile web app development industry, this is very beneficial for your progress as it too is fast-paced and constantly growing.  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
  <p>
While it can provide many benefits, it also has some flaws. You should know is that it is a new tehnology so some of its custom modules may not be included in the framework. And due to its newness, it relies heavily on Facebook (third-party technology) which may or may not be a bad thing to have a third-party. Also, it is not suitable for complex designs and interactions because of their bridge concept. Too many interactions can decrease the app's efficiency.

        <h4 class="font-weight-bold p-4 conclusion"> Conclusion: </h4>
  <p class="mb-2">
All in all, these frameworks has their own advantages and disadvantages to making cross platform apps. It's only a matter of which one you prefer based on the way they provide the views on the device. If you prefer using WebView, want easy access to plug-ins, and use only one platform to make your app, you should choose PhoneGap. If you want high quality, fast app, and usage of widgets, you should choose Flutter. If you think you want to follow the trend, use native components, and one code base for many platforms, then you should pick React Native.
